i'm bin-bash she-bang
with a passion for evrything linux its no surprise that i derived at bin-bash she-bang as my online persona and identity.

#not-a-hacker
i am not a hacker. i am simply curious. i am obsessed with how things work, and how they could work better, how to break things. i am ...well...introvertedly, me!

privacy is paramount, i loathe big-corp, i embrace open-source

#aotearoa is my home
in the land of the long white cloud is where i am. if you are too, the pick-a-boo!
